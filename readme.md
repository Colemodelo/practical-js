### Practical JavaScript with Gordon Zhu
Recently found this project buried in the files of my computer. This is one of my first "coding projects" from the pandemic days and is from a time when I was re-learning Javascript.  
I decided to archive the project on Github as its fun too look back upon and reflect on how far I've come since then.
