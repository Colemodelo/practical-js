### Practical JavaScript with Gordon Zhu
Recently found this project buried in the files of my computer. This is a tutorial project/course from Gordon Zhu and was one of my first "coding projects" from the pandemic days and is from a time when I was re-learning Javascript.  
  
Perhaps, this project is the land before time?  
  
I decided to archive the project here too look back upon and reflect on how far I've come since then.
